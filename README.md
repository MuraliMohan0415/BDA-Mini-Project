🌍 Carbon Emissions by Products: A PySpark Analytics Project

📌 Overview
  This project analyzes CO₂ emissions generated by various products across categories such as packaging, electronics, transport, food, and more.
  The dataset contains 550 records with attributes like carbon emissions, energy used, water consumption, and region.
  We use PySpark for big data handling and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.
  The goal is to discover insights into sustainability and environmental impact.
